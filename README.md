You can install the needed packaged using `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Setup
The adviced way to setup your repository is as follows

- Clone this repo with `git clone` or your git GUI
- Create a new virtual environment `virtualenv env` (if virualenv is not installed run `pip install virtualenv` for more information look [here](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/#lower-level-virtualenv))
- Activate the environment `env\scripts\activate`
- install packages `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Use
If you use a virtual environment (which is highly adviced to maintain the correct versions of dependencies) ensure that you also run `env\scripts\activate` every time before you start to code (otherwise your dependencies won't load)
